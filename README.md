# todo-list

In this project we will create a To Do List web application.
The user will be able to add projects with basic data like milestones or due dates.

For each project, the user will be able to add to-do list items that need to be completed with dates and the ability to check each box completed or not. Once each to-do list item is completed, the Project itself will be completed.

The user will be able to add or delete items as needed.
